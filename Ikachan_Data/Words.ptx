~Greetings~+
+
Pixel here.+
+
This time...+
+
The goal was to make an+
adventure game that anyone can play.+
+
+
The story is set in the+
depths of the sea,+
with you as the hero.+
+
+
After playing,+
if you have any views or comments,+
please let us know to+
the extent possible.+
+
+
+
+
+
+
~Controls~+
+
+
Left/Right: Change direction+
+
+
+
Z key: Thrust+
+
+
+
S key: Inventory+
+
+
+
Just give it a try and you'll+
work out the rest on your own.+
+
The developer is not responsible+
for any issues that may arise.+
+
(This software was produced in good+
faith. We appreciate your+
understanding.)+
+
+
We've prepared a bit of an ending+
for you when you clear the game,+
so do your best~!+
